  "safety_response": "Immediately stop all refueling operations and shut down the generator if safe to do so. Evacuate non-essential personnel from the area. Contain the diesel spill using appropriate absorbent materials and ensure all ignition sources are eliminated. Investigate the cause of the spill and implement corrective actions to prevent future occurrences. Ensure workers are trained in safe refueling procedures and spill response."
